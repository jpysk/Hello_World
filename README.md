# Hello_World
week 6 assignment
Hi. My name is Julia Pysk and I am a junior studying business analytics at the University of Iowa. I am currently in computational thinking so I have a broad general idea of how coding works. We are currently working with software called "Spyder." It has been tricky because this is one of my first coding classes that I have ever taken. I hope it starts to get easier as I learn the patterns and start to understand the material.
